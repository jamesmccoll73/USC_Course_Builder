**Demo:** file:///Users/jamesmccoll/Desktop/csci104/USC_Course_Builder/frontEnd/main.html

**Function:** Takes all possible timeslots of the classes the user wants to take and outputs all possible schedule combinations, ensuring that 1) there are no conflicts between classes and 2) Any lectures that are paired to specific discussions are still paired
